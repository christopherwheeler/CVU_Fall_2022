Hello - my name is Chris Wheeler (he/him) 
I am starting my second year as a PhD student at Kansas Geological Survey and University of Kansas
My advisor is Sam Zipper, and my research focuses on surface water-grounwater interactions in intermittent streams.
Regarding coding and data science, I would consider myself an intermediate user of R.
I have been certified as a Carpentries instructor and am teaching my first workshop next month
(Intro to R for Ecology).

These are my personal goals for this module:
1) "Translate" some of my skills from R into Python
2) Get better at git bash and the command line
3) Add some Python code to my Github page (currently it's all R)
